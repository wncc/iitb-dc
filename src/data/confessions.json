    "content": "I recently came across a \"letter to myself\" written during extremely tough COVID times and I realized my brain had blurred all those memories and even made them better. Dissociative amnesia. Reading that letter made me feel better, even laugh about present trivial obstacles. It explains so much about my situation. My depressive episodes are triggered by lack of sleep and exercise. I have good months when I'm overall productive, extraverted and outgoing and bad months when I suffer from low confidence, anxiety and social withdrawal. This is even apparent from my spi which has a cyclical pattern. But it is exercise that pulls me out every time. Cannot stress the importance of it more. Another line i quote from the letter- \"IIT has made my mental health and life a lot harder\". It did but I also grew. Please reach out to your friends. Be kind and do not, I repeat do not \"compete\" with people. Everyone is forging their own path. Everyone is working towards their own goals. Let's create a positive peer community that helps everyone grow."

Poor parents whose world is me and I just can't tell them that I'm willing to be a bekar. Besides all this, I wanna know something.\nWHY DO WE WORK ??\n \n Just for money ?? If so, Why do women work if they have a husband earning for her ??"
